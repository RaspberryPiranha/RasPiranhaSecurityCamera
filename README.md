# RasPiranhaSecurityCamera
This is essentially a hardware-specific installation of the MotionEyeOS (here: https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos ) for use on the Raspberry Pi 0 Wifi with the low light camera and a standard Raspbian baseline installation.

Here is a list of links saved from the research, without serious categorization (2-3 of these were critical to successful installation, primarily setting up the camera to point to the proper directory source for the motion eye OS to draw video feed from, which was the most difficult detail):
